# Advance python concepts


1. Classes and Objects:

 Classes are blueprints for objects. Objects are instances of classes.

2. Inheritance: 

Allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.

3. Polymorphism:
 Allows different classes to be treated through a common interface.

4. Encapsulation:

 Hides the internal state of an object and only allows changes through defined methods.
These concepts help in organizing and structuring your code in a clear, reusable, and maintainable way.
